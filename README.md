Goal: To recreate a human's aiming profile to be able to gather data on various things:

Human Aiming Profile:

1) Create an artificial Visual Reaction Time (VRT) of 200ms or so
2) Accelerate to quickly flick to far away targets
3) Have it predict the bot's future location and aim accordingly
4) Have it determine the bot's velocity based on its movement and attempt to simulate it

Interests:

1) How important is VRT, given perfect tracking?
2) What are some optimal strafing patterns?
3) Is it best to aim center of mass, or opposite of strafing direction?
